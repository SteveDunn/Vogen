# FAQ

## What tests are there
There are unit tests for Vogen itself, and there are snapshot tests to test that the source code that is generated
matches what is expected.

To run the unit tests for Vogen itself, you can either run them in your IDE, or via `Build.ps1`.
To run the snapshot tests, run `RunSnapshots.ps1`

## I want to add a test, where is the best place for it?

Most tests involve checking two, maybe three, things:
* checking that source generated is as expected (so the snapshot tests in the main solution)
* checking that behavior of the change works as expected (so a test in the `consumers` solution (`tests/consumers.sln`))
* (maybe) - if you added/changed behavior of the code that generates the source code (rather than just changing a template), then a unit test in the main solution

## I've changed the source that is generated, and I now have snapshot failures, what should I do?

There are a **lot** of snapshot tests. A lot of permutations of the following are run:
* framework
* class/struct/record class/record struct
* internal/public/sealed/readonly
* locales
* conversions, such as EF Core, JSON, etc. 

When the tests are run, it uses snapshot tests to compare the current output to the expected output.
If your feature/fix changes the output, the snapshot tests will bring up your configured code diff tool, for instance,
Beyond Compare, and show you the differences. 
If your change modifies what is generated, then it is likely that a lot of `verified` files will need update to match
the new source code that is generated.

To do this, run `RunSnapshots.ps1 -reset`. This will delete all the snapshots and treat what is generated
as the correct version. Needless to say, only do this if you're sure that the newly generated code is
correct.



## How do I identify types that are generated by Vogen?
_I'd like to be able to identify types that are generated by Vogen so that I can integrate them in things like EFCore._

**A: ** You can use this information on [this page](How-to-identify-a-type-that-is-generated-by-Vogen.md)


### What versions of .NET are supported?

The source generator is .NET Standard 2.0. The code it generates supports all C# language versions from 6.0 and onwards

If you're using the generator in a .NET Framework project and using the old style projects (the one before the 'SDK style' projects), then you'll need to do a few things differently:

* add the reference using `PackageReference` in the .csproj file:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="Vogen" Version="[LATEST_VERSION_HERE - E.G. 1.0.18]" PrivateAssets="all" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

* set the language version to `latest` (or anything `8` or more):

```c#
  <PropertyGroup>
+    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
    <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
```

### Does it support C# 11 features?
This is primarily a source generator. The source it generates is mostly C# 6 for compatibility. But if you use features from a later language version, for instance `records` from C# 9, then it will also generate records.

Source generation is driven by attributes, and, if you're using .NET 7 or above, the generic version of the `ValueObject` attribute is exposed:

```c#
[ValueObject<int>]
public partial struct Age { }
```

### Why are they called 'Value Objects'?

The term Value Object represents a small object whose equality is based on value and not identity. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object)

> _In computer science, a Value Object is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity: i.e., two Value Objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object._

In DDD, a Value Object is (again, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design#Building_blocks))

>  _... a Value Object is an immutable object that contains attributes but has no conceptual identity_

### How can I view the code that is generated?

Add this to your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles>true</EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles>
    <CompilerGeneratedFilesOutputPath>Generated</CompilerGeneratedFilesOutputPath>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
    <Compile Remove="Generated/*/**/*.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Then, you can view the generated files in the `Generated` folder. In Visual Studio, you need to select 'Show all files' in the Solution Explorer window:

![the solution explorer window shows the 'show all files' option](20220425061514.png)

Here's an example from the included `Samples` project:

![the solution explorer window showing generated files](20220425061733.png)

### Why can't I just use `public record struct CustomerId(int Value);`?

That doesn't give you validation. To validate `Value`, you can't use the shorthand syntax (Primary Constructor). 
So you'd need to do:

```c#
public record struct CustomerId
{
    public CustomerId(int value) {
        if(value <=0) throw new Exception(...)
    }
}
```

You might also provide other constructors which might not validate the data, thereby _allowing invalid data 
into your domain_. Those other constructors might not throw exception, or might throw different exceptions.  
One of the opinions in Vogen is that any invalid data given to a Value Object throws a `ValueObjectValidationException`.

You could also use `default(CustomerId)` to evade validation.  In Vogen, there are analyzers that catch this and fail the build, e.g.:

```c#
// error VOG009: Type 'CustomerId' cannot be constructed with default as it is prohibited.
CustomerId c = default;

// error VOG009: Type 'CustomerId' cannot be constructed with default as it is prohibited.
var c2 = default(CustomerId);
```

### Can I serialize and deserialize them?

Yes. By default, each VO is decorated with a `TypeConverter` and `System.Text.Json` (STJ) serializer. There are other converters/serializers for:

* Newtonsoft.Json (NSJ)
* Dapper
* EFCore
* LINQ to DB

### Can I use them in EFCore?

Yes, although there are certain considerations. [Please see the EFCore page on the Wiki](https://github.com/SteveDunn/Vogen/wiki/Value-Objects-in-EFCore),
but the TL;DR is:

* If the Value Object on your entity is a struct, then you don't need to do anything special

* But if it is a class, then you need a conversion to be generated, e.g. `[ValueObject<string>(conversions: Conversions.EfCoreValueConverter)]`
  and you need to tell EFCore to use that converter in the `OnModelCreating` method, e.g.:

```c#
        builder.Entity<SomeEntity>(b =>
        {
            b.Property(e => e.Name).HasConversion(new Name.EfCoreValueConverter());
        });
```


### It seems like a lot of overhead; I can validate the value myself when I use it!

You could, but to ensure consistency throughout your domain, you'd have to **validate everywhere**. And Shallow's Law says that that's not possible:

> ⚖️ **Shalloway's Law**
> *"when N things need to change and N > 1, Shalloway will find at most N - 1 of these things."*

Concretely: *"When 5 things need to change, Shalloway will find at most, 4 of these things."*

### If my VO is a `struct`, can I prohibit the use of `CustomerId customerId = default(CustomerId);`?

**Yes**. The analyzer generates a compilation error.

### If my VO is a `struct`, can I prohibit the use of `CustomerId customerId = new(CustomerId);`?

**Yes**. The analyzer generates a compilation error.

### If my VO is a struct, can I have my own constructor?

**No**. The parameter-less constructor is generated automatically, and the constructor that takes the underlying value is also generated automatically.

If you add further constructors, then you will get a compilation error from the code generator, e.g.

```c#
[ValueObject(typeof(int))]
public partial struct CustomerId {
    // Vogen already generates this as a private constructor:
    // error CS0111: Type 'CustomerId' already defines a member called 'CustomerId' with the same parameter type
    public CustomerId() { }

    // error VOG008: Cannot have user defined constructors, please use the From method for creation.
    public CustomerId(int value) { }
}
```

### If my VO is a struct, can I have my own fields?

You *could*, but you'd get compiler warning [CS0282-There is no defined ordering between fields in multiple declarations of partial class or struct 'type'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0282)

### Why are there, by default, no implicit conversions to and from the primitive types that are being wrapped?

Implicit operators can be useful, but for Value Objects, they can confuse things. Take the following code **without** any implicit conversions:

```c#
Age age1 = Age.From(1);
OsVersion osVersion = OsVersion.From(1);

Console.WriteLine(age1 == osVersion); // won't compile! \o/
```

That makes perfect sense. But adding in an implicit operator **from** `Age` **to** `int`, and it does compile!

`Console.WriteLine(age1 == osVersion); // TRUE! (◎_◎;)`

If we remove that implicit operator and replace it with an implicit operator **from** `int` **to** `Age`, it no longer compiles, which is great (we've got type safety back), but we end up [violating the rules of implicit operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/user-defined-conversion-operators):

> Predefined C# implicit conversions always succeed and never throw an exception. User-defined implicit conversions should behave in that way as well. If a custom conversion can throw an exception or lose information, define it as an explicit conversion

In my research, I read some other opinions, and noted that the guidelines listed in [this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/284377/30906) say:

* If the conversion can throw an `InvalidCast` exception, then it shouldn't be implicit.
* If the conversion causes a heap allocation each time it is performed, then it shouldn't be implicit.

Which is interesting—Vogen _wouldn't_ throw an `InvalidCastException` (only an `ValueObjectValidationException`).  Also, for `struct`s, we _wouldn't_ create a heap allocation.

But since users of Vogen can declare a Value Object as a `class` **or** `struct`, then we wouldn't want implicit operators (from `primitive` => `ValueObject`) for just `structs` and not `class`es.

### Can you opt in to implicit conversions?

Yes, by specifying the `toPrimitiveCasting` and `fromPrimitiveCasting` in either local or global config.
By default, explicit operators are generated for both. Bear in mind that you can only define implicit _or_ explicit operators;
you can't have both.

Also, bear in mind that ease of use can cause confusion. Let's say there's a type like this (and imagine that there's implicit conversions to `Age` and to `int`):

```c#
[ValueObject(typeof(int))]
public readonly partial struct Age {
    public static Validation Validate(int n) => n >= 0 ? Validation.Ok : Validation.Invalid("Must be zero or more");
}
```

That says that `Age` instances can never be negative.  So you would probably expect the following to throw, but it doesn't:

```c#
var age20 = Age.From(20);
var age10 = age20 / 2;
++age10;
age10 -= 12; // bang - goes negative??
```

The implicit cast in `var age10 = age20 / 2` results in an `int` and not an `Age`. Changing it to `Age age10 = age20 / 2` fixes it. But this does go to show that it can be confusing.

### Why is there no interface?

> _If I'm using a library that uses Vogen, I'd like to easily tell if the type is just a primitive wrapper or not by the fact that it implements an interface, such as `IValidated<T>`_

Just like primitives have no interfaces, there's no need to have interfaces on Value Objects. The receiver that takes a `CustomerId` knows that it's a Value Object.  If it were instead to take an `IValidated<int>`, then it wouldn't have any more information; you'd still have to know to call `Value` to get the value.

It might also relax type-safety. Without the interface, we have signatures such as this:

```c#
public void SomSomething(CustomerId customerId, SupplierId supplierId, ProductId productId);
```

... but with the interface, we _could_ have signatures such as this:

```c#
public void SomSomething(IValidate<int> customerId, IValidated<int> supplierId, IValidated<int> productId);
```

So, callers could mess things up by calling `DoSomething(productId, supplierId, customerId)`)

There would also be no need to know if it's validated, as, if it's in your domain, **it's valid** (there's no way to manually create invalid instances).  And with that said, there would also be no point in exposing the 'Validate' method via the interface because validation is done at creation.

### Can I represent special values

Yes. You might want to represent special values for things like invalid or unspecified instances, e.g.

```c#
/*
* Instances are the only way to avoid validation, so we can create instances
* that nobody else can. This is useful for creating special instances
* that represent concepts such as 'invalid' and 'unspecified'.
*/
[ValueObject]
[Instance("Unspecified", -1)]
[Instance("Invalid", -2)]
public readonly partial struct Age
{
    private static Validation Validate(int value) =>
        value > 0 ? Validation.Ok : Validation.Invalid("Must be greater than zero.");
}
```

You can then use default values when using these types, e.g.

```c#
public class Person {
    public Age Age { get; set; } = Age.Unspecified
}
```

... and if you take an Age, you can compare it to an instance that is invalid/unspecified

```c#
public void CanEnter(Age age) {
    if(age == Age.Unspecified || age == Age.Invalid) throw CannotEnterException("Name not specified or is invalid")
    return age < 17;
}
```

### Can I normalize the value when a VO is created?
I'd like to normalize/sanitize the values used, for example, trimming the input. Is this possible?

Yes, add NormalizeInput method, e.g.
```c#
    private static string NormalizeInput(string input) => input.Trim();
```
See [wiki](https://github.com/SteveDunn/Vogen/wiki/Normalization) for more information.


### Can I create custom Value Object attributes with my own defaults?

Yes, but (at the moment) it requires that you put your defaults in your attribute's constructor—not in the call to
the base class' constructor (see [this comment](https://github.com/SteveDunn/Vogen/pull/321#issuecomment-1399324832)).

```c#
public class CustomValueObjectAttribute : ValueObjectAttribute<long>
{
    // This attribute will default to having both the default conversions and EF Core type conversions
    public CustomValueObjectAttribute(Conversions conversions = Conversions.Default | Conversions.EfCoreValueConverter) { }
}
```

NOTE: *custom attributes must extend a ValueObjectAttribute class; you cannot layer custom attributes on top of each other*

### Why isn't this concept part of the C# language?

It would be great if it was, but it's not there currently. I [wrote an article about it](https://dunnhq.com/posts/2022/non-defaultable-value-types/), but in summary, there is a [long-standing language proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/146) focusing on non-defaultable value types.
Having non-defaultable value types is a great first step, but it would also be handy to have something in the language to enforce validation.
So I added a [language proposal for invariant records](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/5574).

One of the responses in the proposal says that the language team decided that validation policies should not be part of C#, but provided by source generators.

### How do I run the benchmarks?

`dotnet run -c Release -- --job short --framework net6.0 --filter *`

### Why do I get a build error when running `.\Build.ps1`?

You might see this:
```
.\Build.ps1 : File C:\Build.ps1 cannot be loaded. The file C:\Build.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. 
```

To get around this, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

### What alternatives are there?

[StronglyTypedId](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId)
This is focused more on IDs. Vogen is focused more on 'Domain Concepts' and the constraints associated with those concepts.

[StringlyTyped](https://github.com/stevedunn/stringlytyped)
This is my first attempt and is NON-source-generated. There is memory overhead because the base type is a class. There are also no analyzers. It is now marked as deprecated in favor of Vogen.

[ValueOf](https://github.com/mcintyre321/ValueOf)
Similar to StringlyTyped - non-source-generated and no analyzers. This is also more relaxed and allows composite 'underlying' types.

[ValueObjectGenerator](https://github.com/RyotaMurohoshi/ValueObjectGenerator)
Similar to Vogen, but less focused on validation and no code analyzer.

### What primitive types are supported?

Any type can be wrapped. Serialisation and type conversions have implementations for:
* string

* int
* long
* short
* byte

* float (Single)
* decimal
* double

* DateTime
* DateOnly
* TimeOnly
* DateTimeOffset

* Guid

* bool

For other types, generic type conversion and a serializer are applied. If you are supplying your own converters for type
conversion and serialization, then specify `None` for converters and decorate your type with attributes for your own types, e.g.

```c#
[ValueObject(typeof(SpecialPrimitive), conversions: Conversions.None)]
[System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter(typeof(SpecialPrimitiveJsonConverter))]
[System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter(typeof(SpecialPrimitiveTypeConverter))]
public partial struct SpecialMeasurement { }
```

### I've made a change that means the 'Snapshot' tests are expectedly failing in the build—what do I do?

Vogen uses a combination of unit tests, in-memory compilation tests, and snapshot tests. The snapshot tests are used
to compare the output of the source generators to the expected output stored on disk.

If your feature/fix changes the output of the source generators, then running the snapshot tests will bring up your
configured code diff tool (for example, Beyond Compare), to show the differences. You can accept the differences in that
tool, or, if there are a lot of differences (and they're all expected!), you have various options depending on your
platform and tooling. Those are [described here](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify/blob/main/docs/clipboard.md).

**NOTE: If the change to the source generators expectedly changes the majority of the snapshot tests, then you can tell the
snapshot runner to overwrite the expected files with the actual files that are generated.**

To do this, run `.\Build.ps1 -v "Minimal" -resetSnapshots $true`. This deletes all `snaphsot` folders under the `tests` folder
and treats everything generated as the new baseline for future comparisons.

This will mean that there are potentially **thousands** of changed files that will end up in the commit, but it's expected and unavoidable.

### How do I debug the source generator?

The easiest way is to debug the SnapshotTests. Put a breakpoint in the code, and then debug a test somewhere.

To debug an analyzer, select or write a test in the AnalyzerTests. There are tests that exercise the various analyzers and code-fixers.

### How do I run the tests that actually use the source generator?

It is challenging to run tests that _use_ the source generator in the same project **as** the source generator, so there
is a separate solution for this. It's called `Consumers.sln`. What happens is that `build.ps1` builds the generator, runs
the tests, and creates the NuGet package _in a private local folder_. The package is version `999.9.xxx` and the consumer
references the latest version. The consumer can then really use the source generator, just like anything else.

> Note: if you don't want to run the lengthy snapshot tests when building the local nuget package, run `.\Build.ps1 -v "minimal" -skiptests $true`

### Can I get it to throw my own exception?

Yes, by specifying the exception type in either the `ValueObject` attribute, or globally, with `VogenConfiguration`.

### I get an error from Linq2DB when I use a ValueObject that wraps a `TimeOnly` saying that `DateTime` cannot be converted to `TimeOnly`—what should I do?

Linq2DB 4.0 or greater supports `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly`. Vogen generates value converters for Linq2DB; for `DateOnly`, it just works, but for `TimeOnly, you need to add this to your application:

`MappingSchema.Default.SetConverter<DateTime, TimeOnly>(dt => TimeOnly.FromDateTime(dt));`

### Can I use protobuf-net?

Yes. Add a dependency to protobuf-net and set a surrogate attribute:

```c#
[ValueObject(typeof(string))]
[ProtoContract(Surrogate = typeof(string))]
public partial class BoxId {
//...
}
```

The BoxId type will now be serialized as a `string` in all messages and grpc calls. If one is generating `.proto` files
for other applications from C#, proto files will include the `Surrogate` type as the type.
